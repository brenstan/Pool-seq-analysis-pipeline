# Pool-seq-analysis-pipeline
Annotated step-by-step pipeline that I used to analyze Pool-seq data generated from the Illumina HiSeq X. 
This is the pipeline I used to analyze the Pool-seq data. I have generalized each step so that future students can adjust it to their projects. For my project, I analyzed five sites of *Physella johnsoni* and three sites of *Physella gyrina* of 20 to 40 individuals per site. These were sequenced by Genome Quebec on the Illumina HiSeq X, aiming for about 40x coverage (determined to be almost double that in actuality). Each site consisted of half a lane worth of data (total of four lanes).
I have also included the pdf - because it looks nicer and I think it is easier to follow.
